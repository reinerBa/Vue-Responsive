**Breaking Changes for verison 1.x:** 

- **Tag is now `v-responsive` the old `v-responsiveness` is no longer supported.**
- **The file `Vue_Responsive.common.js` does no longer exist** 

Is a directive to use responsive breakpoints on html elements. Because sometimes it's nice to have a chance to let the view do resolution specific things.

- **No further Dependencies** 
- **ðŸ”§ Chrome, Firefox, IE11+**


ðŸ“º Check the [Demo](https://reinerba.github.io/Vue-Responsive/dist/)-link (IE11-[Demo](http://reinerba.github.io/Vue-Responsive/Demo.html) without webpack)

ðŸ“– [Docs](https://reinerba.github.io/Vue-Responsive/Documentation/)

## ðŸ”§  Install
`npm install vue-responsive`

```javascript

import responsive from 'vue-responsive'
Vue.use(responsive)
```

## ðŸ‘ˆ Shortest usecase

Just put the breakpoint identifiers behind the directive with dots:

```html

   <div v-responsive.lg.xl >Only visible on desktop !</div>

   <div v-responsive.md    >Visible on tablet â˜º</div>

   <div v-responsive.sm.xs >Only visible on smartphone!</div>
```

## ðŸ‘ˆ Small usage example

```javascript

<template>
  <div>
    <h1 v-responsive="'hidden-xs'">Big Title</h1>
    <div v-responsive="['hidden-all','xs','sm']">
      Only visible in small and extra-small windows
    </div>

    <h1 v-responsive="middleSize">Big Jumbotron</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import vueResponsive from 'vue-responsive'
  Vue.directive('responsive', vueResponsive)
  ...
  data:{
	middleSize: ['hidden-all','lg','xl']
  } 
</script>
```

# Features

This directive adds responsive Feautures to single HTML-Elements without CSS or @Media.

The default Responsive breaks follow Bootstrap 4 [Responsive Utils](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/responsive-utilities/).

The Bootstrap 3 breakpoints are includes as well.

# Usage

In the browser just include the script and use the directive on a Html-Element inside a Vue Element

    <script src="Vue-Responsive.min.js"></script>

**Advanced:** If you do not want the directive to be globally available just add the attribute *notGlobal* with a not empty value in the script tag and define it the components with:


```html

    <script src="Vue-Responsive.min.js" notGlobal="true" ></script>	
	...
	directives:{
		// the global variable is 'index.vueResponsive'
		responsive: index.vueResponsive
	}
```

## For Bootstrap 4 breakpoints
At default every resolution is visible, the hidden-all tag changes this to everything hidden (display:none). These tags are valid **hidden-all**, **xs**, **sm**, **md**, **lg**, **xl**, **hidden-xs**,...,**hidden-xl**.

```javascript

  <h1 v-responsive="'hidden-xs'">Big Title</h1>
  <div v-responsive="['hidden-all','md','lg']">Only visible in Middle and large Size View</div>
  <div v-responsive="['hidden-lg']">Only hidden at lg</div>

  <h1 v-responsive="middleSize">Jumbotron</h1>
  ...	//in the vue object
  data:{
    middleSize:['hidden-all','lg','xl']
  } 

```

## For Bootstrap 3 breakpoints
Just add **:bs3** after the directive to use bootstrap 3 breakpoints:

```javascript

  <p v-responsive:bs3="['hidden-xs']">
    As you can see on the big picture below.<br /><img ... />
  </p>

```

In this defintion the **xl** breakpoint doesn't exist.

## For self defined breakpoints 
First you have to declar your own breakpoints in the component/root wich wraps the html-elements with the directive. Every definition must start with **responsiveMarks$$** and a following name. So you can easily create breakpoints to differentiate between desktop and smartphones for instance, as you can see in the demo.html:
	
```javascript

  <p v-responsive:twoMarks="'hidden-desktop'">
    Visible on smartphone<br />
    <img src="http://lorempixel.com/360/240/animals" />
  </p>

  ... //in the vue object
  data:{
    responsiveMarks$$twoMarks: {  //set a custom breakpoint with the name "twoMarks"
      smartphone: { 
        show: true, 
        min: -1, 
        max: 767 
      }, 
      desktop: { 
        show: true, 
        min: 768, 
        max: Infinity 
      } 
    }
  } 

```

You can declar as much own definitions as you wish. Every defintion should have **min:-1** for its smalles breakpoint and **max:Infinity** for its biggest.


### Planned 
  - Mixin to trigger methods on breakpoint change
  - Add and remove classes instead of changing only the style
